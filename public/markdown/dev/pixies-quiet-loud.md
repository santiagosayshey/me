# Loud Quiet Loud

The Pixies broke up in 1993 and nobody really cared. They'd never had a gold record. MTV barely played them. Rolling Stone ignored them. Seven years later, every rock band on earth was trying to sound like them.

Kurt Cobain admitted he was basically trying to rip off the Pixies when he wrote "Smells Like Teen Spirit." David Bowie called them the most important band of the 80s. Thom Yorke said hearing them changed his life. How did four college dropouts from Boston accidentally create the blueprint for alternative rock?

## The Formula Nobody Knew They Needed

Black Francis (or Frank Black, or Charles Thompson - the guy had identity issues) discovered something stupidly simple: **whisper, whisper, whisper, SCREAM**.

Listen to "Tame" - it starts with this gentle, almost sleepy bassline. Kim Deal's voice floats over it like smoke. Then 45 seconds in, Francis starts shrieking about being tame and the guitars explode. It's jarring. It's uncomfortable. It's perfect.

```
Volume dynamics in "Tame":
0:00-0:45: ~40-50 dB (conversational volume)
0:46-1:10: ~95-100 dB (jackhammer level)
1:11-1:30: Back to 45 dB
1:31-end:  Full assault again
```

This wasn't new - classical music had dynamics. Jazz had dynamics. But nobody in rock was doing it this violently, this suddenly. The Pixies made whiplash into an art form.

## The Weirdest Band Meeting Ever

Spring 1986, Boston. Charles Thompson puts an ad in the Phoenix:

> $icon: newspaper
> Band seeks bassist into Hüsker Dü and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please - no chops.

"No chops" might be the most important two words in alternative rock history. He didn't want virtuosos. He wanted people who played like they were still figuring it out.

Kim Deal showed up. She'd never played bass before - she was a guitarist. She got the job.

Joey Santiago answered the ad. His main qualification? He and Charles had suitemates at UMass who both had nervous breakdowns the same week. That was their bonding experience.

David Lovering was recruited at Kim's wedding reception. He was an electronic engineer who played drums as a hobby. Perfect.

Their first recording session was a disaster. Purple Tape (recorded at Fort Apache Studios for $1000) sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom. Because parts of it literally were. The engineer kept making them redo takes because Francis wouldn't stop laughing during his own screaming parts.

But Steve Albini heard it. So did Ivo Watts-Russell from 4AD. Suddenly this band that couldn't get a gig in Boston was recording in Q Division studios, where Aerosmith and The Cars worked.

## Surfer Rosa: The Album That Broke Everything

**Come On Pilgrim** was good. **Surfer Rosa** was alien.

Albini recorded it in two weeks. His technique:
- Drums in a concrete loading dock for natural reverb
- Amps in separate rooms, bleeding into each other's mics
- Francis's vocals through a guitar amp
- Everything too loud, mixed too raw

The album opens with "Bone Machine" - two minutes of Francis talk-singing about pedaling a bike to make a bone machine go. What the fuck is a bone machine? Nobody knows. That's the point.

Then "Break My Body." Then "Something Against You." Then "Broken Face" - 90 seconds of pure violence with Francis screaming "I've got no lips, I've got no tongue" while Santiago's guitar sounds like it's being murdered.

| Track | Length | Screaming % | Comprehensibility |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Bone Machine | 3:01 | 15% | Zero |
| Break My Body | 2:05 | 40% | Low |
| Something Against You | 1:47 | 60% | None |
| Broken Face | 1:30 | 80% | What? |
| Gigantic | 3:54 | 10% | Actually clear |
| River Euphrates | 2:33 | 25% | Biblical? |
| Where Is My Mind? | 3:53 | 20% | Swimming metaphors |
| Cactus | 2:16 | 35% | Deeply weird |

"Where Is My Mind?" became their signature - that swimming pool story about watching the fish while doing backstroke. It's in Fight Club's ending. It's in Mr. Robot. It's covered by everyone from Placebo to Bassnectar. But in 1988, college radio barely touched it.

## Doolittle: Trying to Be Normal (Failed Successfully)

The label wanted a hit. Gil Norton was brought in to produce - he'd done Echo & the Bunnymen, The Triffids. Make it shinier, they said. Make it more accessible.

What they got was an album about surrealism, biblical violence, and slicing up eyeballs.

> $author: Black Francis, 1989
> I was trying to write about the most horrific things I could imagine, but make them sound like pop songs. Like if The Everly Brothers sang about dismemberment.

"Debaser" opens with Francis screaming about Un Chien Andalou, a 1929 surrealist film where someone's eye gets sliced with a razor. This was their idea of commercial.

But it worked. "Here Comes Your Man" actually got MTV play. "Monkey Gone to Heaven" charted in the UK. The album went gold... in 2006, seventeen years after release.

**The Doolittle Tour Numbers:**
- 67 shows
- 11 countries  
- Average venue size: 1,200 people
- Times Francis and Deal spoke to each other: approaching zero

They were barely a functioning band. Francis and Deal communicated through their manager. Santiago was drinking heavily. Lovering was the only one who seemed happy, learning magic tricks backstage.

## The Influence Nobody Saw Coming

1991: Nirvana releases "Smells Like Teen Spirit"  
1992: Every A&R guy in America starts signing "the next Pixies"  
1993: The actual Pixies break up via fax machine  

Francis literally faxed the band to tell them it was over. They found out from a journalist calling for comment.

But here's what happened next:

**Radiohead** - Jonny Greenwood said the Pixies taught him you could be experimental and still write songs. Listen to "Creep" - it's "Where Is My Mind?" with British accents.

**Weezer** - Rivers Cuomo studied their song structures obsessively. Loud-quiet-loud, but make it nerdy.

**Smashing Pumpkins** - Billy Corgan: "The Pixies showed us you could be heavy without being metal."

**PJ Harvey** - Worked with Steve Albini specifically because of Surfer Rosa. Learned that raw could be beautiful.

**Arcade Fire** - Win Butler called them "the band that made me realize you could do whatever you wanted."

## Why Them? Why Then?

The Pixies worked because they didn't try to be cool. They were four nerds making noise:

- **Francis**: Overweight, screaming about UFOs and biblical plagues
- **Deal**: Chain-smoking mom from Dayton, Ohio  
- **Santiago**: Filipino immigrant who learned guitar from his psychiatrist
- **Lovering**: Electronic engineer who collected vintage radio equipment

They looked like your coworkers. They sounded like the apocalypse.

College rock in 1987 was R.E.M. being earnest, The Smiths being sad, U2 being important. The Pixies showed up talking about broken faces and dead sailors. They weren't trying to change the world. They were just weird.

## The Reunion Nobody Asked For

2004: The Pixies reunite. Coachella pays them $1 million. They sell out in minutes.

Suddenly they're headlining festivals, playing arenas, making more money in one tour than in their entire original run. The kids who were -5 years old when Doolittle came out are screaming along to "Debaser."

But it's strange. Deal and Francis still don't talk. They use separate dressing rooms. The shows are note-perfect recreations of 1989 performances. No new songs for ten years.

When they finally record new material (Indie Cindy, 2014), nobody cares. It's fine. It sounds like the Pixies. But you can't accidentally invent the future twice.

## The Recipe

Want to start a band that changes everything? Here's the Pixies formula:

1. **Can't sing?** Scream instead
2. **Can't play?** Play anyway  
3. **No image?** Good
4. **No message?** Even better
5. **Make pop songs** about surrealist horror
6. **Break up** right before you get famous
7. **Let everyone else** get rich copying you
8. **Reunite** 15 years later for the money

The beautiful part? It can't be replicated. The Pixies happened because four specific weirdos met at a specific time in a specific place. They didn't know they were creating a template. They were just trying to be loud and quiet and loud again.

Every band since 1989 has had to deal with their shadow. The loud-quiet-loud thing became such a cliché that bands started doing quiet-loud-quiet just to be different. Then loud-loud-loud. Then giving up and going electronic.

But nobody's matched that original formula: make the prettiest ugly songs possible, scream about nonsense, break up before anyone notices you're important.

The Pixies proved you don't need virtuosity. You don't need a message. You don't need to be cool. You just need to mean it, even if nobody knows what "it" is.

*Especially* if nobody knows what it is.
